                    Incepted in January , 2011 by Mr. Aman Chawla. Greenfield Cricket Academy has been envisioned to become the foremost nurturing grounds for young and emerging talent in the country.This is a youth club with an aim to promote cricketing talent. We want to give an opportunity to those talented players who are not able to play cricket at higher level due to lack of opportunity, finance etc. Cricketing talent cannot be created. Once discovered, it can only be nurtured. It is this belief that guides us at GCA. Every boy who joins us is treated as an individual – one who is quite unlike any other in the Academy.

                    Greenfield Cricket Academy with a vision to pioneer the growth of young cricketing talent from the grassroot levels of India. Cricket has always been a popular sport in India; every young kid aspires to become a cricket legend like Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev and many others. But not all are lucky enough to display their talent and play for the country. Cricketing Talent is ample in our country but organized cricket tournaments at a basic and smaller level are very few in India.The state of the art facilities offered to the young sportsmen at the very grass root level not only helps in nurturing the aspirations of these budding talents but also helps them to imbibe the myriad benefits derived by participating in them.
